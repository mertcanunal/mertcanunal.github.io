Hello everyone,


I am Mert Can. I am senior year Control and Automation Engineering student at Yildiz Technical University. I started writing a blog to archive my projects neatly and share them with everyone. Currently, I am working on projects about image processing and computer vision on OpenCV. Also, because python is my favorite language for coding, there will always be some python projects now and then.
